# Trading Platform Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Trading Platform Project repository. This platform is designed to facilitate robust trading strategies and provide real-time financial data visualization. Our goal is to create a reliable and scalable solution that caters to both amateur traders and financial professionals.

## Getting Started
